To Done is a web app aimed at young adults and teens.  The goal of the design is to be very clean and simple. In order to achieve this, most of the functions in the app have to be available without having to look for them or click through: no big lists or menuâ€™s in order to find what the user needs. To make the app more accessible for new users, the app can be used via the splash screen without creating an account. The main todo page features two columns, one for labels and one for todo list items. The todo list item column lists items chronologically, with the option to add an item always on top. When adding an item users can set the due date on the same line. Adding extra notes or labels, reminders or recurring items can be done with a click on the + page, since these options will not be used by all users.
